# Final-Project
This project focuses on predicting patient appointment no-shows using healthcare data. A decision tree model was used to identify key factors influencing no-shows, such as SMS reminders, age, and weekdays. The insights are visualized in a Power BI dashboard to support scheduling improvements and reduce missed appointments.
